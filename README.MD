This project is meant to help New Yorkers understand the differences between the express and local lines regarding stations reached by time. The website has animations to show how quickly different lines reach stops. It also displays counters at the bottom to help readers see the vast difference between express and local lines. I opted to work only with the Blue Line since that is my most traveled line, and I had a personal reason for seeing the differences between the A and C lines. The attached screenshots show the website and the counter display shows how quickly the A train stops, whereas the C lags behind by a large margin.

The reason I chose this topic was because it was something I was inspired to create based on a project for my Urban Transportation Course. In that course, I studied the Staten Island Railway and pitched ways to improve the railway; one of my recommendations was to offer express trains. This project helps me develop an argument for this recommendation further.  

The numbers for express vs local trains were pulled from a 2016 MTA study regarding the F train. This source can be found here: https://new.mta.info/sites/default/files/2019-09/F%20express%20study%202019-07-26.pdf
