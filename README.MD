This project is meant to help New Yorkers understand the differences between the express and local lines in terms of stations reached by time. The website has animations to show how quickly different lines reach stops and also displays counters at the bottom to help readers see the vast difference between express and local lines. I opted to only work with the Blue Line since that is my most traveled line and had a peronsal reason in seeing the differences between the A and C lines. The attached screenshots show the website and the counter display shows how quickly to A train reaches stops whereas the C lags behind by a large margin.
